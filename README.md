# Data_Preprocessing

I have explored many feature Engineering and Feature selection Techniques to Handle missing values, Handling outliers, Categorical Feature Encoding, Feature Scalling and  important feature selection

**Major Learning from Working on Projects**

**Feature Engineering**

**Different Feature Scaling Techniques**
- Normalization and Standardization
- Scaling to Minimum and Maximum values
- Scaling to Median and Quantiled
- Guassian Transformation
  - Logarithmic Transformation
  - Reciprocal Trnasformation
  - Square Root Transformation
  - Exponential Transformation
  - Box Cox Transformation
  
**Types of Encoding for categorical variables**

- Nominal Encoding
  - One hot encoding
  - One hot encoding with many categorical variables
  - Mean encoding
  - Count/Frequency Encoding

- Ordinal Encoding
  - Label Encoding
  - Target Guided Ordinal Encoding


**Feature Selection**
select important features --> reduce curse of dimensionality

**Steps to select best features**
Drop constant features using variance threshold
Drop features with high Correlation
